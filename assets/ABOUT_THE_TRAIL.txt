The Holcomb Tree Trail is an arboretum managed by the Friends of Holcomb Farm at the historic Holcomb Farm property owned by the Town of Granby, Connecticut. 

Located in fields that once had been grazing land for dairy cows, the Holcomb Tree Trail is now a beautiful place for quiet outdoor activity and enjoyment, as well as a place for education and scientific study with a focus on trees, shrubs, and wildlife habitat.

We have planted and labeled over 150 new trees and shrubs along more than two miles of mowed meadow paths. The trees are sited to preserve the stunning 180-degree views looking west. 

Many mature trees on the paths are also labeled and we have many interpretive signs which focus on trees, farm history, and invasive plants.
